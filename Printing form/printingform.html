    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: What type of materials do you have?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: The materials we offer here at the AVC are: PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU, and Resin 
        <ul>
          <li><u>PLA</u>: offers great printing quality and good strength, but can warp when exposed to high temperatures for a long period of time.</li>
          <li><u>ABS</u>: Has decent print quality and is slightly less brittle than PLA, has a higher resistance to temperature than PLA. <strong>ABS has minor shrinkage so scale your model up by 2%</strong>.</li>
          <li><u>PETG</u>: Good print quality and is less brittle than PLA/ABS. There’s a slight flex to it making it great for snap-fitting parts. Has a higher resistance to temperature than PLA.</li>
          <li><u>TPU</u>: An extremely flexible material that is great for making parts that can bend and stretch without breaking. This material is incredibly strong and has many interesting qualities. Perfect for phone cases!</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: When and how can I pay for my print?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: We ask that you pay for your print upon pickup. We do not accept cash or credit/debit cards as a form of payment, we only accept BullBucks. The process for uploading Bulls Bucks into your account is very simple! Please visit <a href="https://www.usf.edu/it/bull-bucks/">https://www.usf.edu/it/bull-bucks/</a> for more information!</p>

      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: Where is the Advanced Visualization Center 3D print lab located?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: We are located at CMC 153</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: What software can I use to design a part?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: Programs such as Meshmixer (free) and Maya (free) are great 3d sculpting programs for creating organic models. Fusion 360 (free) and SolidWorks (free at USF) are great for making precise and/or parametric designs, especially when creating projects that involve many parts that will need multiple iterations</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: What unit of measurement should I use to design my parts in?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: Typically, designs made for 3D printing are done in millimeters (mm) so we suggest designing the parts you submit in millimeters. However, if the part you submit happens to be designed in inches, we can easily convert it, just be sure to let us know!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: How big can my 3D model be?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: Generally, we suggest prints be smaller than 225mm x 140mm x 150mm. However, with approval, we will allow prints up to 250mm x 280mm x 300mm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: My model is too big, what do I do???</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: If your model exceeds our printers’ build volume, and the exact dimensions of your model are not important, you can specify the size you’d like it to be (in mm) and we can rescale it for you. If reducing the size of your model is not an option, there are many ways to split your model up into smaller pieces that can later be joined together. To learn how to do this we suggest watching <a href="https://youtu.be/Tgc66TvEke4?t=58">this tutorial</a> to use MeshMixer, a free application, to cut a large models into smaller, printable pieces.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: Where can I find parts that are already designed?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">www.Thingiverse.com</a> and <a href="http://www.myminifactory.com/">www.MyMiniFactory.com</a> have tons of 3D designs that you can download for free!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: What quality should I chose?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: Quality can have a huge impact on your part, but printing in the highest quality isn’t always the best choice. A higher print quality will greatly increase the printing time, thus increasing price as well. Parts with a lower quality will print faster and decrease the final price. For example, a print with a 0.1mm layer height will take twice as long as the same print with a 0.2mm layer height.
        <ul>
          <li><u>High Quality (0.1mm/0.15mm)</u>: Great for printing small parts with lots of important details (only on the x/y axis), like miniatures and decorative pieces, but will lack in strength making it a poor choice for functional parts.</li>
          <li><u>Medium Quality (0.2mm)</u>: The most common quality used, good for a balance between detail and strength.</li>
          <li><u>Low Quality (0.25mm/0.3mm)</u>: This is best when printing parts that need to be really strong. They will suffer some loss in quality but can really take a beating before breaking.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: How will infill percentage and shell count impact my print?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: A higher infill percentage and shell count will result in a stronger part, but can greatly increase printing time, thus increasing the final price of your part. We recommend 10% infill and 2 shells for a good balance between strength and price, even lower if your design will undergo several iterations, to get a quick and cheap print that you can use to test and modify.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question"><strong><em>Q: What types of 3D printing do you offer?</em></strong></p>
      <p class="answer">A: We currently offer FDM and SLA 3D printing. 99% of our prints are done using FDM as this is the quicker, cheaper, and easiest method - but in special cases we will allow parts to be printed using SLA. However, we recommend talking to staff about this beforehand to ensure that it is the best decision.</p>
